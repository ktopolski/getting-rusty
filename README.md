# Getting a little rust-y

So, I heard about this Rust thing for a while now and I decided to give it a shot lately.

Turns out learning curve is really nice with official rust book, so expect more of Rust repos! :)

So far(only basic syntax), things I definitely love in Rust:

- `Result` and `Option` enums are very pleasant experience...
- ...especially with this sweeeeet pattern matching!
- Type inference is actually impressive
- ...but not as impressive as error messages in the compiler - never seen any errors THAT helpful!
- It's a nice touch that `break` returns a value(and thus whole `loop` returns a value) - makes a pleasant UI loop writing experience
- Official documentation is pretty well maintained, with examples and what not

If you're wondering if you should give Rust a shot - go do it :).
